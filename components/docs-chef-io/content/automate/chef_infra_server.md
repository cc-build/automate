## Overview

The __Chef Infra Server__ page shows all the Chef Infra Servers connected to Chef Automate. The __Chef Infra Server__ user interface can be used to view and manage all the Chef Infra Server Objects like:

- Cookbooks
- Roles
- Environments
- Data Bags
- Clients

The __Chef Infra Server__ acts as a hub for configuration data. The Chef Infra Server stores **cookbooks**, the policies that are applied to **nodes**, and metadata that describes each registered node that is being managed by Chef Infra Client. Nodes use Chef Infra Client to ask the Chef Infra Server for configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions. Chef Infra Client then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the Chef Infra Server). This scalable approach distributes the configuration effort throughout the **organization**.

## Connect to the Chef Infra Server

To start making use out of the Chef Infra Server, firstly deploy and run [Chef Automate](https://docs.chef.io/automate/install/#installation-guide) instance.

Selecting a specific added Chef Server opens the list of organizations in the Server. Refer to the image below:

![Chef Infra Server Organization](/images/automate/chef-server-organization.png)

The Organization in the Chef server listed are the ones which are already created in that specific server. To create a new Organization in the Server click [here](https://docs.chef.io/automate/infra_server/#set-up-the-chef-infra-server).

To add the previously created organization to the Infrastructure, click on the **Add Chef Organization** button. Refer to the image below:

## Access Chef Infra Server Objects

The **Chef Infra Server Objects** can be managed from the Chef Automate. In Automate Infra views, following objects can be managed:

- Cookbooks
- Roles
- Environments
- Data Bags
- Clients

Refer to the image below:

![Chef Infra Server Objects](/images/automate/chef-infra-server-objects.png)

### Cookbooks

A [cookbook](https://docs.chef.io/cookbooks/) is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. include recipes and other files, components, or directories.

### Roles

[Roles](https://docs.chef.io/roles/) let you define patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job function. Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run-list.

### Environments

An [environment](https://docs.chef.io/environments/) can be used to map an organizationâ€™s real-life workflow to what can be configured and managed when using Chef Infra. This mapping is accomplished by setting attributes and pinning cookbooks at the environment level.

### Data Bags

[Data bags](https://docs.chef.io/data_bags/) store global variables as JSON data. Data bags are indexed for searching and can be loaded by a cookbook or accessed during a search.

### Clients

Chef Infra Clients provide secure API access to the Chef Infra Server.

## Troubleshoot

While fetching any object like cookbooks or any, if it raises the `Could not get cookbooks: organization 'no-org' does not exist` error, the provided organization does not exist on Chef Infra Server. The error looks like as shown below:

![Could not get cookbooks: Organization](/images/automate/could-not-get-cookbooks-organization.png)

Create the Chef Organization using the knife command, `knife opc org create` or the Chef Infra Server CLI `chef-server-ctl org-create`. Then add the **Name**, **Projects**, **Admin User**, and **Admin Key** to fetch the objects.
