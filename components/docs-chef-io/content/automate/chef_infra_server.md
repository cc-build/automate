Click on the listed Servers to view the details of the specific **Chef Server**.

## Connect to the Chef Infra Server Organization

Selecting a specific added Chef Server opens the list of organizations in the Server. Refer to the image below:

![Chef Infra Server Organization](/images/automate/chef-server-organization.png)

The Organization in the Chef server listed are the ones which are already created in that specific server. To create a new Organization in the Server click [here](https://docs.chef.io/automate/infra_server/#set-up-the-chef-infra-server).

To add the previously created organization to the Infrastructure, click on the **Add Chef Organization** button. Refer to the image below:

![Add Chef Organization](/images/automate/add-chef-organization-button.png)

![Add Chef Organization Popup Menu](/images/automate/add-chef-organization-popup-menu.png)

Add the Name, Projects, Admin User, and Admin Key. Always use the exact details that were provided at the time of setting up **Knife**. Copy the contents of the `~/.chef/USER.pem` file and past it into the **Admin Key** field. Once done click **Add Chef Organization**. The desired organization will be added to the Chef Server.

Refer to the image below:

![Chef Infra Server Objects](/images/automate/chef-infra-server-objects.png)

### Cookbooks

A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. Cookbooks also comprise recipes and other optional components or directories. Click [here](https://docs.chef.io/cookbooks/) to know more about Cookbooks.

### Roles

A role is a way to define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job function. Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run-list. Click [here](https://docs.chef.io/roles/) to know more about Roles.

### Environments

An environment is a way to map an organizationâ€™s real-life workflow to what can be configured and managed when using Chef Infra. This mapping is accomplished by setting attributes and pinning cookbooks at the environment level. Click [here](https://docs.chef.io/environments/) to know more about Environments.

### Data Bags

Data bags store global variables as JSON data. Data bags are indexed for searching and can be loaded by a cookbook or accessed during a search. Click [here](https://docs.chef.io/data_bags/) to know more about Data Bags.

### Clients

Chef Infra Clients provide secure API access to the Chef Infra Server.

## Troubleshoot

While fetching any object like cookbooks or any, if it raises the `Could not get cookbooks: organization 'no-org' does not exist` error, the provided organization does not exist on Chef Infra Server. The error looks like as shown below:

![Could not get cookbooks: Organization](/images/automate/could-not-get-cookbooks-organization.png)

Create the Chef Organization either from `knife opc org create` or using `chef-server-ctl org-create`. Once done add the exact details to fetch the objects.
