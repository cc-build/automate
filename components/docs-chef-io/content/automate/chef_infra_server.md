## Overview

The _Chef Infra Server_ page shows all the Chef Infra Servers connected to Chef Automate. The Chef Infra Server user interface can be used to view and manage all the Chef Infra Server Objects like:

- Cookbooks
- Roles
- Environments
- Data Bags
- Clients

The _Chef Infra Server_ acts as a hub for configuration data. The Chef Infra Server stores _cookbooks_, the policies that are applied to _nodes_, and metadata that describes each registered node that is being managed by Chef Infra Client. Nodes use Chef Infra Client to ask the Chef Infra Server for configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions. Chef Infra Client then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the Chef Infra Server). This scalable approach distributes the configuration effort throughout the _organization_.

## Connect to the Chef Infra Server

To start making use out of the Chef Infra Server, firstly deploy and run [Chef Automate](https://docs.chef.io/automate/install/#installation-guide) instance.

**Note:** Chef Automate automatically displays your connected Chef Infra Servers.

Login to Chef Automate using the credentials. Once logged in, the page looks like as shown below:

![Chef Automate](/images/automate/chef-automate-on-chef-infra-page.png)

Click on _Infrastructure_ located at the top bar of the page. Then select _Chef Servers_ located at the left panel of the page. The page looks like as shown below:

![Chef Infra Server](/images/automate/chef-server-page.png)

The above image is the _Chef Server_ page which contains all the Chef Infra Servers connected to the Chef Automate. The Chef Infra Servers listed are the ones that are already configured and added to the Chef Automate. To create a new Infra Server click [here](https://docs.chef.io/automate/infra_server/).

To add the created Chef Server to the Infrastructure, click on _Add Chef Server_ button. Clicking on the Add Chef Server button opens a popup menu as shown below:

![Add Chef Server Popup Menu](/images/automate/add-chef-server-popup-menu.png)

Mention the correct Name, FQDN, and IP Address of the system. Click _Add Chef Server_. The desired server gets added to the Chef Infra Server.

**Note:** If the mentioned FQDN and IP Address is incorrect, the box displays an error as shown below:

![Add Chef Server Popup Menu](/images/automate/add-chef-server-popup-menu-with-error.png)

Click on the listed Servers to view the details of the specific _Chef Server_.

## Connect to the Chef Infra Server Organization

Selecting a specific added Chef Server opens the list of organizations in the Server. Refer to the image below:

![Chef Infra Server Organization](/images/automate/chef-server-organization.png)

The Organization in the Chef server listed are the ones which are already created in that specific server. To create a new Organization in the Server click [here](https://docs.chef.io/automate/infra_server/#set-up-the-chef-infra-server).

To add the previously created organization to the Infrastructure, click **Add Chef Organization** button. Clicking on the button opens a popup menu as shown below:

![Add Chef Organization Popup Menu](/images/automate/add-chef-organization-popup-menu.png)

Add the Name, Projects, Admin User, and Admin Key. Always use the exact details that were provided at the time of setting up _Knife_. Copy the contents of the `~/.chef/USER.pem` file and past it into the _Admin Key_ field. Once done click **Add Chef Organization**. The desired organization will be added to the Chef Server.

Click on any Chef Organization to view the _Objects_.

## Access Chef Infra Server Objects

The Chef Infra Server Objects can be managed from the Chef Automate. In Automate Infra views, following objects can be managed:

- Cookbooks
- Roles
- Environments
- Data Bags
- Clients

Refer to the image below:

![Chef Infra Server Objects](/images/automate/chef-infra-server-objects.png)

### Cookbooks

A [cookbook](https://docs.chef.io/cookbooks/) is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. include recipes and other files, components, or directories.

### Roles

[Roles](https://docs.chef.io/roles/) let you define patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job function. Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run-list.

### Environments

An [environment](https://docs.chef.io/environments/) can be used to map an organizationâ€™s real-life workflow to what can be configured and managed when using Chef Infra. This mapping is accomplished by setting attributes and pinning cookbooks at the environment level.

### Data Bags

[Data bags](https://docs.chef.io/data_bags/) store global variables as JSON data. Data bags are indexed for searching and can be loaded by a cookbook or accessed during a search.

### Clients

Chef Infra Clients provide secure API access to the Chef Infra Server.

## Troubleshoot

While fetching any object like cookbooks or any, you might face an error `Could not get cookbooks: organization 'no-org' does not exist`, which means the provided organization does not exist on Chef Infra Server. The error looks like as shown below:

![Could not get cookbooks: Organization](/images/automate/could-not-get-cookbooks-organization.png)

Create the Chef Organization using the knife command, `knife opc org create` or the Chef Infra Server CLI `chef-server-ctl org-create`. Then add the _Name_, _Projects_, _Admin User_, and _Admin Key_ to fetch the objects.
